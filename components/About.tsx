                    Hello! I'm Sandeep Reddy, a passionate Computer Science graduate with a strong inclination towards building robust and user-friendly web applications. My journey into technology started with a fascination for problem-solving, which has evolved into a career focused on leveraging the MERN stack, Python, and Java to create impactful digital experiences.

                <p>
                    Throughout my academic and internship experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projectsâ€”from an AI-powered object identifier to a comprehensive procurement portal. These experiences have honed my technical abilities and taught me the importance of collaboration and clean code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am driven by a desire to continuously learn and adapt in the ever-evolving tech landscape. I'm currently seeking an entry-level role where I can contribute my skills and grow as a software engineer.
